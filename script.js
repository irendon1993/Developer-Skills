// We work for a company building a smart home thermometer. Our most recent task is this: "Given an array of temperatures of one day,
 calculate the temperature amplitude. Keep in mind that sometimes there might be a sensor error."

// 1) Understanding the problem with temperature
// What is temp amplitude? Answer: differnce between highest and lowest temp
